				//   reasons other than #HotIf Win. (such as mouse, overriding OS hotkeys, or hotkeys

				//   via the message, but that would require malloc-there and free-here, and might
				//   result in memory leaks if its ever possible for messages to get discarded by the OS.
				// - It allows hotkeys that were eligible for firing at the time the message was
				//   posted but that have since become ineligible to be aborted.  This seems like a
				//   good precaution for most users/situations because such hotkey subroutines will
				//   often assume (for scripting simplicity) that the specified window is active or

				// to avoid generating unnecessary disguise-keystrokes.  They are not needed because if our keystrokes
				// were modified by either WIN or ALT, the release of the WIN or ALT key will already be disguised due to
				// its having modified something while it was down.  The exceptions to this are when vk is a mouse button

				// Win/Alt don't have to be disguised but our caller would have trouble tracking that info or making that

					// of the single SendInput/Play call.  The reasons it's done here as part of the array are:
					// 1) It avoids the need for A_HotkeyModifierTimeout (and it's superior to it) for both SendInput
					//    and SendPlay.
					// 2) The hook will not be present during the SendInput, nor can it be reinstalled in time to
					//    catch any physical events generated by the user during the Send. Consequently, there is no
					//    known way to reliably detect physical keystate changes.
					// 3) Changes made to modifier state by SendPlay are seen only by the active window's thread.
					//    Thus, it would be inconsistent and possibly incorrect to adjust global modifier state
					//    after (or during) a SendPlay.
					// So rather than resorting to A_HotkeyModifierTimeout, we can restore the modifiers within the
					// protection of SendInput/Play's uninterruptibility, allowing the user's buffered keystrokes
					// (if any) to hit against the correct modifier state when the SendInput/Play completes.
					// For example, if #c:: is a hotkey and the user releases Win during the SendInput/Play, that
					// release would hit after SendInput/Play restores Win to the down position, and thus Win would
					// not be stuck down.  Furthermore, if the user didn't release Win, Win would be in the
					// correct/intended position.
					// This approach has a few weaknesses (but the strengths appear to outweigh them):
					// 1) Hitting SendInput's 5000 char limit would omit the tail-end keystrokes, which would mess up
					//    all the assumptions here.  But hitting that limit should be very rare, especially since it's
					//    documented and thus scripts will avoid it.
					// 2) SendInput's assumed uninterruptibility is false if any other app or script has an LL hook
					//    installed.  This too is documented, so scripts should generally avoid using SendInput when
					//    they know there are other LL hooks in the system.  In any case, there's no known solution

				// v1.0.42.04: A previous call to SendKey() might have left Shift/Ctrl in the down position
				// because by procrastinating, extraneous keystrokes in examples such as "Send ABCD" are
				// eliminated (previously, such that example released the shift key after sending each key,
				// only to have to press it down again for the next one.  For this reason, some modifiers
				// might get released here in addition to any that need to get pressed down.  That's why
				// SetModifierLRState() is called rather than the old method of pushing keys down only,
				// never releasing them.
				// Put the modifiers in mods_to_set into effect.  Although "true" is passed to disguise up-events,

				// released them.  One possible exception to this is when the user physically released Alt or Win
				// during the send (perhaps only during specific sensitive/vulnerable moments).
				// g_modifiersLR_numpad_mask is used to work around an issue where our changes to shift-key state
				// trigger the system's shift-numpad handling (usually in combination with actual user input),
				// which in turn causes the Shift key to stick down.  If non-zero, the Shift key is currently "up"

			// Notes about modifier key behavior on Windows XP (these probably apply to NT/2k also, and has also
			// been tested to be true on Win98): The WIN and ALT keys are the problem keys, because if either is
			// released without having modified something (even another modifier), the WIN key will cause the
			// Start Menu to appear, and the ALT key will activate the menu bar of the active window (if it has one).
			// For example, a hook hotkey such as "$#c::Send text" (text must start with a lowercase letter
			// to reproduce the issue, because otherwise WIN would be auto-disguised as a side effect of the SHIFT
			// keystroke) would cause the Start Menu to appear if the disguise method below weren't used.
			//
			// Here are more comments formerly in SetModifierLRStateSpecific(), which has since been eliminated
			// because this function is sufficient:
			// To prevent it from activating the menu bar, the release of the ALT key should be disguised
			// unless a CTRL key is currently down.  This is because CTRL always seems to avoid the
			// activation of the menu bar (unlike SHIFT, which sometimes allows the menu to be activated,
			// though this is hard to reproduce on XP).  Another reason not to use SHIFT is that the OS
			// uses LAlt+Shift as a hotkey to switch languages.  Such a hotkey would be triggered if SHIFT
			// were pressed down to disguise the release of LALT.
			//
			// Alt-down events are also disguised whenever they won't be accompanied by a Ctrl-down.
			// This is necessary whenever our caller does not plan to disguise the key itself.  For example,
			// if "!a::Send Test" is a registered hotkey, two things must be done to avoid complications:
			// 1) Prior to sending the word test, ALT must be released in a way that does not activate the
			//    menu bar.  This is done by sandwiching it between a CTRL-down and a CTRL-up.
			// 2) After the send is complete, SendKeys() will restore the ALT key to the down position if
			//    the user is still physically holding ALT down (this is done to make the logical state of
			//    the key match its physical state, which allows the same hotkey to be fired twice in a row
			//    without the user having to release and press down the ALT key physically).
			// The #2 case above is the one handled below by ctrl_wont_be_down.  It is especially necessary
			// when the user releases the ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey suffix, which would otherwise
			// cause the menu bar (if any) of the active window to be activated.
			//
			// Some of the same comments above for ALT key apply to the WIN key.  More about this issue:
			// Although the disguise of the down-event is usually not needed, it is needed in the rare case
			// where the user releases the WIN or ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey's suffix.
			// Although the hook could be told to disguise the physical release of ALT or WIN in these
			// cases, it's best not to rely on the hook since it is not always installed.
			//
			// Registered WIN and ALT hotkeys that don't use the Send command work okay except ALT hotkeys,
			// which if the user releases ALT prior the hotkey's suffix key, cause the menu bar to be activated.
			// Since it is unusual for users to do this and because it is standard behavior for  ALT hotkeys
			// registered in the OS, fixing it via the hook seems like a low priority, and perhaps isn't worth
			// the added code complexity/size.  But if there is ever a need to do so, the following note applies:
			// If the hook is installed, could tell it to disguise any need-to-be-disguised Alt-up that occurs
			// after receipt of the registered ALT hotkey.  But what if that hotkey uses the send command:
			// there might be interference?  Doesn't seem so, because the hook only disguises non-ignored events.

				// IMPORTANT UPDATE for v1.0.39: Now that the hooks are in a separate thread from the part

				// keystrokes would become problematic or at least change.  However, this is apparently not
				// the case.  MSDN doesn't spell this out, but testing shows that what happens with a low-level
				// hook is that the moment a keystroke comes into a thread (either physical or simulated), the OS
				// immediately calls something similar to SendMessage() from that thread to notify the hook
				// thread that a keystroke has arrived.  However, if the hook thread's priority is lower than
				// some other thread next in line for a timeslice, it might take some time for the hook thread
				// to get a timeslice (that's why the hook thread is given a high priority).
				// The SendMessage() call doesn't return until its timeout expires (as set in the registry for
				// hooks) or the hook thread processes the keystroke (which requires that it call something like
				// GetMessage/PeekMessage followed by a HookProc "return").  This is good news because it serializes
				// keyboard and mouse input to make the presence of the hook transparent to other threads (unless
				// the hook does something to reveal itself, such as suppressing keystrokes). Serialization avoids
				// any chance of synchronization problems such as a program that changes the state of a key then
				// immediately checks the state of that same key via GetAsyncKeyState().  Another way to look at
				// all of this is that in essence, a single-threaded hook program that simulates keystrokes or
				// mouse clicks should behave the same when the hook is moved into a separate thread because from
				// the program's point-of-view, keystrokes & mouse clicks result in a calling the hook almost
				// exactly as if the hook were in the same thread.

			// Release both shifts before going down on lalt/ralt or lctrl/rctrl (but not necessary if going down on
			// *both* alt+ctrl?
			// Release alt and both controls before going down on lshift/rshift.
			// Rather than the below, do the above (for the reason below).
			// But if do this, don't want to prevent a legit/intentional language switch such as:
			//    Send {LAlt down}{Shift}{LAlt up}.
			// If both Alt and Shift are down, Win or Ctrl (or any other key for that matter) must be pressed before either
			// is released.
			// If both Ctrl and Shift are down, Win or Alt (or any other key) must be pressed before either is released.
			// remind: Despite what the Regional Settings window says, RAlt+Shift (and Shift+RAlt) is also a language hotkey (i.e. not just LAlt), at least when RAlt isn't AltGr!
			// remind: Control being down suppresses language switch only once.  After that, control being down doesn't help if lalt is re-pressed prior to re-pressing shift.
			//
			// Language switch occurs when:
			// alt+shift (upon release of shift)
			// shift+alt (upon release of lalt)
			// ctrl+shift (upon release of shift)
			// shift+ctrl (upon release of ctrl)
			// Because language hotkey only takes effect upon release of Shift, it can be disguised via a Control keystroke if that is ever needed.
			// NOTES: More details about disguising ALT and WIN:
			// Registered Alt hotkeys don't quite work if the Alt key is released prior to the suffix.
			// Key history for Alt-B hotkey released this way, which undesirably activates the menu bar:
			// A4  038      d   0.03    Alt
			// 42  030      d   0.03    B
			// A4  038      u   0.24    Alt
			// 42  030      u   0.19    B
			// Testing shows that the above does not happen for a normal (non-hotkey) alt keystroke such as Alt-8,
			// so the above behavior is probably caused by the fact that B-down is suppressed by the OS's hotkey
			// routine, but not B-up.
			// The above also happens with registered WIN hotkeys, but only if the Send cmd resulted in the WIN
			// modifier being pushed back down afterward to match the fact that the user is still holding it down.
			// This behavior applies to ALT hotkeys also.
			// One solution: if the hook is installed, have it keep track of when the start menu or menu bar
			// *would* be activated.  These tracking vars can be consulted by the Send command, and the hook
			// can also be told when to use them after a registered hotkey has been pressed, so that the Alt-up
			// or Win-up keystroke that belongs to it can be disguised.
			// The following are important ways in which other methods of disguise might not be sufficient:
			// Sequence: shift-down win-down shift-up win-up: invokes Start Menu when WIN is held down long enough
			// to auto-repeat.  Same when Ctrl or Alt is used in lieu of Shift.
			// Sequence: shift-down alt-down alt-up shift-up: invokes menu bar.  However, as long as another key,
			// even Shift, is pressed down *after* alt is pressed down, menu bar is not activated, e.g. alt-down
			// shift-down shift-up alt-up.  In addition, CTRL always prevents ALT from activating the menu bar,
			// even with the following sequences:
			// ctrl-down alt-down alt-up ctrl-up
			// alt-down ctrl-down ctrl-up alt-up
			// (also seems true for all other permutations of Ctrl/Alt)
