# README #

Keysharp is a fork and improvement of the abandoned IronAHK project, which itself was a C# re-write of the C++ AutoHotKey project.

This project is in an extremely early state and should not be used by anyone. Very little of the original AHK functionality works and the syntax is not the same for most of the language.

Do NOT use this in any way until it is ready.
