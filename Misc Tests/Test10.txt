ideas for how variable dereferencing would/could/should work

-assigning as references with & will not work, so none of:
	For example, x := &y takes a reference to y and assigns it to x, then %x% := 1 assigns to the variable y and %x% reads its value.
	
-dereferencing should work like so:
	x := 123
	y := "x"
	z := %y%
	MsgBox(z)
